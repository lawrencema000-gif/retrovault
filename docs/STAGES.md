# RetroVault / Pulsar — Stage Tracker

> **✅ All 10 stages' foundations laid and building green.**
> **📋 Execution now follows [`MASTERPLAN.md`](MASTERPLAN.md) — 27 steps (P1–P27), one per session.**
> **📍 CURRENT STEP → P5: First light on the user's physical device [DEVICE SESSION — everything is staged]**
> **   (ALL code steps P6–P17 + P19–P24 + P27 done on the emulator; P18 + P25–P26 are device-gated.)**
>
> ✅ **ADHOC MULTIPLAYER v1 (2026-07-17, commit 26b537e — suite OK 71):** the NETPLAY.md GO
> verdict implemented, staged behind the default-off "Multiplayer networking (beta)" toggle.
> Native GET_USERNAME env case + nativeSetUsername (nickname rides the LAUNCH INTENT — the
> :emu process's AppPrefs snapshot goes stale in a cached process; pushed unconditionally so
> blank CLEARS g_username, which no per-session reset touches). Persistent MAC (`AdhocMac`,
> locally-administered unicast) pushed as ppsspp_change_mac_address01..12 — **keys built with
> ASCII padStart, NEVER "%02d".format (locale-localized digits silently no-op the whole
> mechanism; truth-table test pins the literal key under ar-EG)**. MULTIPLAYER settings
> category (WLAN/curated server picker/host-on-LAN/UPnP) flows through the existing
> applyToCore pipeline; extras rows = nickname editor, custom-host editor (blank clears; the
> core's magic "IP address" preset literal refused; custom value cycles to the EDITOR, not
> destroyed), live wlan-site-local device-IP + MAC helper. 13 review findings fixed pre-commit.
> NetplayTest (4): key truth table, MAC persistence, nickname round-trip, BG3 renders 120
> frames with WLAN + built-in adhoc server live on the AVD. **Before PUBLIC enablement:**
> two-device LAN session [DEVICE], IARC "Users Interact" re-rating + Data-safety updates
> (LAUNCH_CHECKLIST), troubleshooting page.
>
> ✅ **DEFERRED-POLISH BATCH CLEARED (2026-07-17, commit 432c215 — suite OK 67):** the six debt
> items recorded since the novice audit are done (Gold feature-gating stays a user product
> decision). Download CTA shows a live % (worker setProgress, resume-aware totals, remembered
> status flow = ONE WorkManager subscription per screen); settings changed in the main process
> now live-apply to a running game (EmulatorActivity.onResume re-resolves → GET_VARIABLE_UPDATE
> + display config); licenses sheet loads all texts once off-main (per-item state didn't survive
> LazyColumn recycling); SAF scans probe 16MB first w/ full-copy fallback gated on copy-loop
> ground truth (COLUMN_SIZE can be null) and skipped for content-blind chd/cso; widget/shortcut
> launch of a DIFFERENT game while one runs switches cleanly (onNewIntent → process-local intent
> stash + recreate; relaunch reuses the record's ORIGINAL intent, hence the stash). **Hardening
> from the 3-lens adversarial review (7 confirmed findings fixed pre-commit): overlapping native
> sessions — EmulatorSession.start() now WAITS for a live run loop to die (10s) and
> nativeStartSession refuses to arm over one (starting anyway cancels the old loop's pending
> stop and wedges the :emu process).**
>
> ✅ **ADS DROPPED — Gold-only monetization (2026-07-17, user decision):** resolved the P22 audit's
> GPL flag (AdMob/UMP linked into the same APK as the GPL PPSSPP core has no exception in the
> core's grant). AdMob + UMP removed entirely from the `full` flavor (AdBanner/AdsInit twins,
> manifest APPLICATION_ID, catalog entries); Play Billing (Gold) stays; GoldFeature.NO_ADS
> retired; PRIVACY/NOTICE/DISTRIBUTION/MASTERPLAN amended ("no advertising SDKs in any build").
> **New permanent gates `:app:verifyFull{Debug,Release}RuntimeClasspath`** ban UMP as a group and
> gms `play-services-ads*` by module prefix — full CAN'T ban all of gms because **Play Billing
> itself transitively pulls play-services-base/tasks/location** (the gate's first run caught
> exactly that). All four gates + both flavors build green; merged full manifest has zero ad
> references, BILLING permission intact; suite re-run green. `docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` added —
> every remaining user-side step (device session, Play Console, RA approval clock, Sentry,
> signing, F-Droid, BG3 provenance). No AdMob account needed anymore.
>
> ✅ **P27 done (2026-07-16, code half — commit d739e95):** Skins, widgets, netplay verdict.
> **`.pulsarskin` v1**: zip (skin.json) with normalized control positions/scales/visibility,
> global opacity, and **custom buttons** — multi-button combos in three modes (press / toggle
> latch / ~10 Hz turbo). `PulsarSkin` (parse/validate/round-trip) + `SkinStore`
> (install/activate/delete); `TouchOverlayView` applies skins (per-group re-layout from
> normalized cx/cy, custom-button hit-testing, latched+turbo masks merged into the pushed
> snapshot) and `currentSkin()` exports the live layout — Controls tab gained import (SAF) /
> export / active-skin cycler, so the default layout is exportable as a starter skin.
> **Continue playing**: `RecentPlays` (last game + accumulated playtime) feeds a Glance
> home-screen widget (one tap → resume straight into the emulator), a dynamic "Continue"
> launcher shortcut (MainActivity trampoline), and a "You've played this for 3h 24m" chip on
> the game detail page. **Netplay go/no-go** ([`NETPLAY.md`](NETPLAY.md), 3-agent research
> workflow adversarially verified against the pinned v1.20.4 source): **GO** on config-level
> PSP adhoc (~2–4 days: core options already wired to g_Config; needs GET_USERNAME env case,
> persistent MAC, curated server picker — LAN-first honest scope, IARC "Users Interact" +
> Data-safety updates before shipping), **NO-GO** frame-sync netplay (libretro FAQ: PSP
> impossible), **DEFER** infrastructure mode (absent from the port) + the CGNAT relay patch
> (exposure-only, post-1.0). SkinTest (round-trip + combo/toggle via real MotionEvents on the
> laid-out overlay) — full suite **OK (67 tests)**. **Deferred to device:** skin feel /
> drag-to-edit layout editor UI; curated skin gallery needs hosted content (post-1.0);
> ScreenScraper box-art needs written commercial approval first; PiP optional.
>
> ✅ **P24 done (2026-07-14, code half — commits 9788970 + f725034):** PS1 polish. **Right analog
> end-to-end** (native snapshot → JNI → InputHub → GamepadMapper stick routing → SDL-db rightx/
> righty) — **and a latent P7 bug fixed: the floating TOUCH stick never reached the core**
> (InputHub.push sent pad values only; now pushes the merged sticks — re-verify on device).
> **Ps1Settings registry** (renderer / resolution scale / PGXP / true color / widescreen + aspect)
> mapped to source-verified `swanstation_*` keys (guard test pins each string). **DualShock
> selection**: no core option exists — new `nativeSetControllerDevice` (digital=1 / DualShock=261,
> run-loop-latched) + `ForceAnalog` so sticks work immediately; DualShock is the default.
> **GameShark paste import** (import-only): `Ps1CheatCodes.normalize` emits the exact
> `retro_cheat_set` format ('+'-joined 8+4 hex pairs — the core rejects newlines and has no
> decryption); per-serial manual-code storage merged into the cheat list; CheatsSheet "+ Add a
> GameShark code" panel on PS1 sessions (@Serializable fix on Cheat caught by the round-trip
> test). Ps1Test now 8 tests — full suite **OK (65)** + foss gate. **Deferred to device:**
> dual-stick TOUCH layout (feel work), PS1 full-speed-with-PGXP acceptance.
>
> ✅ **P23 done (2026-07-14, code half — commit 48418cf):** PS1 bring-up (SwanStation). **Research
> workflow (3 researchers + adversarial verifier, all primary-source):** SwanStation pinned by SHA
> `f901022198da` (no upstream tags exist), GPL-3.0, deps vendored; **the sector math was verified
> byte-exact against DuckStation's iso_reader.cpp** before shipping. **Key finding: SwanStation
> embeds an OpenBIOS fallback (MIT, PCSX-Redux) — PS1 boots WITHOUT a user BIOS** → BIOS is now
> "recommended, never required" (requiresBios(PS1)=false; the player no longer blocks). **CI** builds
> `swanstation_libretro_android.so` for both ABIs (buildbot-mirror invocation + 16KB flag + readelf
> gate). **Identification:** `DiscSectorSource` (raw 2352-byte .bin: sync-sniff, MODE1 +16 /
> MODE2-XA +24) + `CueSheet` + `Ps1Serial` (SYSTEM.CNF BOOT → `SLUS-12345`; PSX.EXE homebrew →
> stable fake id) + GameIdentifier PS1 branch + scanner content-refinement (no more PS1-as-fake-PSP
> misfiles). **BIOS-by-hash:** `Ps1Bios` (24 canonical dumps, MD5 — the same set the core's own
> bios.cpp matches); Settings import identifies + renames to the canonical filename ("Recognized:
> NTSC-U v3.0 → scph5501.bin"), rejects imposters; EmulatorActivity stages imported dumps into the
> libretro system dir (top-level, where the core scans). **GameDB:** none to import — SwanStation's
> per-game compat is compiled-in GPLv3 code; the core applies it natively (NOTICE records this +
> the OpenBIOS attribution + pin). Ps1Test — **OK (5)**; full suite **OK (61 tests)**. **STAGED
> (device session):** boot a real PS1 game (CI core .so + a user game dump; BIOS optional).
>
> ✅ **NOVICE SELF-AUDIT + FIX BATCH (2026-07-12, commit 1405649 — suite OK 56):** a 6-journey
> "complete emulator novice" walkthrough (multi-agent, adversarially verified where capacity
> allowed) found and fixed the app's worst traps. **The flagship: "import your own games" was a
> silent dead end** — files were copied to a directory nothing read, onboarding dropped the picked
> folder URI, and the fully-tested P6 library engine had ZERO UI callers. Now: **ON THIS DEVICE**
> library section (ICON0 art, tap-to-play, SAF copy-on-play, import feedback, onboarding folder
> persisted + scanned, Settings LIBRARY row, PS1/PS2 files labeled future). **Store truth:** the
> six placeholder seed games were LIVE in the real catalog — unpublished (3 real titles remain);
> download CTA now observes WorkManager (FAILED—RETRY reachable, retries capped, Wi-Fi-only
> setting honored — it was silently ignored); detail-page dead controls removed/wired (per-game
> settings route added); Home search works; header no longer claims "Your Library"/"Welcome back"
> on first run. **Player:** menu now pauses the game; boot spinner (black screen read as a crash);
> quick save/load/rewind/screenshot give feedback; screenshot no longer hijacks with a share
> chooser; plain-language standby copy + real UNAVAILABLE branch; back skips the rating sheet.
> **Settings:** BIOS imports size-validated (any file used to earn "Installed ✓"); cheat.db
> failure message; honest Vulkan label; de-jargoned copy; launcher renamed RetroVault→**Pulsar**.
> Deferred (recorded): download progress %, cross-process live-apply of video settings,
> singleTask onNewIntent edge, licenses-sheet perf, Gold feature gating via Entitlements.has(),
> scanTree full-file-copy perf on huge folders.
>
> ✅ **P22 done (2026-07-11, code half):** Release hardening + distribution. **A 3-agent audit
> workflow (NOTICE completeness / GPL obligations / F-Droid+Play policy) set the verdicts; the
> design+verify agents hit the subagent session cap, so the design was applied solo against the
> audits.** **GPL compliance:** license + notice texts now ship **inside the APK** (GPLv3 §4/§6 —
> a URL is not a copy): NOTICE.md + LICENSE are copied from the repo root at build time
> (drift-proof gradle task → generated assets) alongside canonical GPL-2.0/Apache-2.0/MIT/OFL-1.1/
> BSD-3/zlib texts; a new Settings **ABOUT** section renders them (LicensesSheet) with the
> GPLv3 badge + **source-code link (§6d corresponding-source offer)**. **NOTICE.md corrected per
> audit (7 fixes):** OFL fonts (Chakra Petch + Manrope — the biggest miss), **AMD FidelityFX FSR
> RCAS attribution** (the P19 sharpen pass is a port — MIT notice added in NOTICE + in
> video_gl.cpp), sharp-bilinear lineage, all Maven deps, full-only proprietary SDK rows, libchdr
> note, stale "planned" section dissolved, "unmodified" statement added. **Update check:**
> foss-flavor-only (Play build ships ZERO update-check code — Play Device & Network Abuse policy,
> RetroArch precedent; F-Droid tolerates user-initiated) — manual Settings row → GitHub
> releases/latest → opens the releases page; 404/no-releases handled as "up to date".
> **Crash reporting:** Sentry (MIT SDK) full-only via fullImplementation, **opt-in default-OFF**
> toggle, inert without a DSN (BuildConfig via CI secret, empty today). **🐛 The new test caught
> a real crash:** Sentry's manifest ContentProvider auto-inits at process start and throws
> without a DSN → disabled via `io.sentry.auto-init=false` (full manifest); only the explicit
> gated init path remains. **Distribution:** `fdroid/com.retrovault.app.yml` template +
> `docs/FDROID.md` (verdict: F-Droid REQUIRES cores built from source — PPSSPP-model submodule +
> shared build script is the pre-submission blocker; RetroArch's NonFreeNet outcome is what we
> avoid), fastlane changelog + GPL/source sentence in full_description, PRIVACY.md synced
> (Sentry/compat/RA sections), `dependenciesInfo.includeInApk=false` (reproducibility), README
> status refreshed. **16KB re-verified:** all 8 native libs (libpulsar_retro + 3 cores × 2 ABIs)
> at 0x4000; both release variants assemble; foss gates green. LegalTest (license texts in-APK +
> update-check truth table) — **OK (2)**; full suite **OK (56 tests)**. **⚠️ CRITICAL LAUNCH
> DECISION (from the audit, needs the user):** the **full** APK combines the GPL PPSSPP core with
> proprietary AdMob/UMP/Billing in one binary — PPSSPP's GPL grant has no exception for that, so
> shipping full-with-ads to Play is a GPL-compliance risk no NOTICE edit cures. Options before
> Play launch: drop AdMob from full (Gold-only monetization), seek clarity/exception, or
> restructure. foss is clean. **⚠️ STAGED (accounts/device):** QA matrix, Play listing +
> data-safety + signing ceremony, F-Droid cores-from-source + submission, 1.0 tag + release with
> corresponding-source pointers, real Sentry DSN.
>
> ✅ **P21 done (2026-07-07):** Monetization — AdMob + Pulsar Gold (Play Billing) + a proprietary-free
> `foss` flavor. **Product-flavor dimension `distribution`** (`full`/`foss`) on exactly the 3 modules
> on the monetization path — `:app → :feature-store → :data-billing` — so variant-aware resolution
> propagates `foss` all the way down; the other 11 modules stay dimensionless (and `feature-player`
> not depending on feature-store **structurally enforces "ads never in-game"**). Proprietary deps
> (`billing-ktx` 7.1.1, `play-services-ads` 23.6.0, `user-messaging-platform` 3.1.0) live ONLY in
> `fullImplementation` → foss classpaths get **zero**. **Billing:** `BillingManager` interface in main
> + flavor factory `createBillingManager()` — `full` = **PlayBillingManager** (Play Billing v7: connect,
> queryProductDetails, launchBillingFlow, PurchasesUpdatedListener, **server-verify the token BEFORE
> granting**, acknowledge, restore=queryPurchasesAsync so Gold survives reinstall); `foss` =
> **FreeBillingManager** (Gold unavailable, free tier intact). **Ads:** `AdBanner` composable declared
> per-flavor (full = AdMob `AdView` in library chrome, hidden for Gold, **UMP consent before init**;
> foss = empty), wired into the library only. **Server-verified entitlement:** `supabase/functions/
> verify-purchase` (mints a Play-service-account OAuth token → Play Developer API
> `purchases.products.get`, grants only when `purchaseState===0`; **fails closed** without the SA
> secret). **`:app:verifyFoss{Debug,Release}RuntimeClasspath`** Gradle gate walks the resolved foss
> dependency graph and fails the build on any Google proprietary group — wired into `check`. The
> design→adversarial-verify Workflow caught 5 issues pre-code (the `LocalBillingManager` interface-break,
> a manifest-placeholder timing risk → hardcoded the test AdMob id, task-rename docs). **Acceptance
> proven:** foss build has ZERO proprietary deps (mechanically verified: `fossDebugRuntimeClasspath`
> grep empty; foss merged manifest has no ads/BILLING) while full carries all three + the AdMob
> APPLICATION_ID; full suite **OK (54 tests)** on `connectedFullDebugAndroidTest`. **⚠️ STAGED (needs
> Play Console + merchant + AdMob account + a Play service-account secret):** the live "test purchase
> survives reinstall" acceptance, real AdMob ids (test ids used now), deploying verify-purchase.
> DISTRIBUTION.md updated (bundleFullRelease / assembleFossRelease).
>
> ✅ **P20 done (2026-07-07):** RetroAchievements (hardcore-compliant). **rcheevos v11.6.0 (MIT)
> vendored** (`core-emulator/src/main/cpp/rcheevos/`, 30 `.c`, provenance recorded) + compiled into
> `libpulsar_retro.so` as a STATIC lib (both ABIs) — `RC_DISABLE_LUA` + **`RC_CLIENT_SUPPORTS_HASH`**
> (gates the identify/load decls) + `_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE`. Native **`rc_bridge.cpp`** wraps `rc_client`
> single-owner on the run-loop thread: read-memory via `rc_libretro` + `retro_get_memory_data` (and the
> captured `SET_MEMORY_MAPS` descriptors); **HTTP routed to Kotlin OkHttp** (`RaHttpPump`) — rc_client
> emits `url`+`post_data`, a native queue hands it to OkHttp, the completion is **marshalled back and the
> callback invoked on the run-loop thread** (never the OkHttp thread); event handler → JSON event queue +
> per-game list/summary snapshots; `rc_client_do_frame` per emulated frame; login/token + Keystore token
> store (`RaCredentialStore`, EncryptedSharedPreferences); **stable User-Agent** `Pulsar/<v> (Android …)
> rcheevos/11.6`. **Hardcore interlock refined to RA's real rules** (drove a P10Test update): state-LOAD
> **blocked** (single `retro_unserialize` choke point), rewind blocked, **slow-mo blocked but
> fast-forward ALLOWED** (was wrongly pinned to 100), cheats cleared on hardcore-enable, **creating**
> states allowed; one-way hardcore→casual; `RC_CLIENT_EVENT_RESET`→`retro_reset`. **Achievement progress
> rides inside save states** via a backward-compatible 28-byte `PULSARRA` footer (legacy states still
> load). Teardown fixed per the adversarial verifier: abort async → fail owed HTTP callbacks (no bridge
> mutex held) → unload → destroy → free regions, all BEFORE `dlclose`. **A research→design→adversarial-
> verify Workflow (6 agents) caught 10 real issues** before a line was written — 2 build blockers
> (`RC_CLIENT_SUPPORTS_HASH`; `rc_version_string()`=="11.6" not "11.6.0"), a teardown UAF, and an
> on-device-dead-hardcore risk (must plumb the memory map, not just SYSTEM_RAM). RaTest (testgl-free,
> BG3): rcheevos links + version, rc_client create/destroy, **HTTP marshals to the run-loop thread**,
> progress-container round-trip; on the live PSP session — **PPSSPP exposes 32 MB SYSTEM_RAM** and reads
> land in mapped RAM; **hardcore blocks state-load + slow-mo + cheats, allows FF + create-save; softcore
> re-allows load**; RA session begins + tears down clean (0 in-flight) — **OK (2)**; full suite **OK (54
> tests)**. **⚠️ STAGED (needs an RA account + RA-side approval of Pulsar as a compliant emulator, a
> ~6-month public clock):** real login, real unlock in softcore + hardcore, achievement-list populate,
> privacy-policy/monetization-disclosure publish. Deferred to P5 device: on-hardware 90-vs-270 (P19) +
> real unlock once approved.
>
> ✅ **P19 done (2026-07-07):** Display polish — stackable post-shaders, rotation, scale modes,
> gallery screenshots. **Native present pipeline rebuilt** (`video_gl`): the game frame resolves
> into a clean native-res **scene FBO** (single V-flip, CLAMP_TO_EDGE) then runs **0–2 stacked
> post passes** (ping-pong) — only the final blit rotates + scales. **Three shaders authored +
> adversarially verified** (an 8-agent workflow; the verifier caught + fixed real bugs — a
> mediump `sin()` phase-precision blow-up in the CRT pass, and an RCAS overshoot-clamp that
> deleted isolated highlights): **CRT scanlines** (highp-guarded, fract-wrapped phase + aperture
> mask), **FSR 1.0 RCAS sharpen** (5-tap, ring-free), **sharp-bilinear** (Themaister). Adjustable
> uniforms (scanline/mask/sharpen strength). **Rotation via geometry** (`uPosRot` mat2, exact 90°
> multiples) — keeps screen-space scanlines display-aligned and dodges the double-flip trap;
> **90/270 swap the letterbox aspect** for vertical-shmup TATE. **Scale modes** fit / integer
> (pixel-perfect, **FIT fallback on downscale**) / stretch. State hygiene per frame (scissor off
> **before** clear, depth/cull/blend off, black clear). JNI `nativeSetDisplayConfig` +
> `nativeShaderSelfTest` (compiles all programs on the render thread → bitmask); 6 new VIDEO
> settings (rotation/scale/shader/scanline/sharpen + anisotropic) resolver-driven via
> `applyDisplay`. **Screenshots now publish to the gallery** (MediaStore → Pictures/Pulsar) +
> share-sheet from the player. ShaderTest (testgl core): all 4 programs compile+link, CRT+FSR
> stack presents under 90°+integer with live uniform re-apply, screenshot queryable in MediaStore
> — **OK**; full suite **OK (52 tests)**. **🔧 Fixed a latent suite flake:** CheatTest depended on
> FirstLightTest (sorts later) having installed Battlegrounds 3 — green only when it lingered from
> a prior run; it now self-provisions BG3 (shared `TestGames` helper) so the suite is
> order-independent. Deferred to P5 device: on-hardware CW/CCW 90-vs-270 confirm + real TATE feel.
>
> 🎆 **P5-prep done — FIRST LIGHT ACHIEVED ON EMULATOR (2026-07-04):** the real, license-verified
> GPL-3.0 homebrew **Battlegrounds 3** (github.com/xfacter/battlegrounds3, mirrored with recorded

> install → playable resolution (EBOOT.PBP) → **PPSSPP core booted it and presented 129 frames**.
> FirstLightTest OK. Store UI now has real Download→Downloading→Play states. PSP placeholders

> `_S`/`_G`/`_C0/_C1`/`_L` format, dashless-serial normalization), `CheatManager` (import from
> **SAF file or URL — validated, NEVER bundled**; per-serial enabled set as JSON; default-on

> ✅ **P13 done (2026-07-06):** In-app compat reporting + game-page surfacing. **Account-less
> design** (auth accounts arrive later): reports key on a persistent install UUID; the
> `submit-compat-report` edge function validates (serial pattern, rating 1–5, size caps) and
> inserts with the service role; a **DB unique index enforces once per install+serial+
> app-version** and a **trigger maintains `compat_summary`** (count/avg/last). **App:**
> `CompatReporter` (installId, prompt policy ≥10 min + once per serial+version, submit,
> public `summaryFor`); post-session **CompatRatingSheet** (5 tiers Broken→Perfect + optional
> graphics/audio/speed sub-scores) shown on quit when eligible, auto-filling device info
> (SoC/GPU family/ABI/SDK/backend) + the user's settings diff + core version; game detail
> pages show a **"Community ★ x.x · N reports"** chip when the installed game's serial has
> reports. **🐛 Fixed along the way: menu-quit called session.stop() before finish(), which
> skipped the onDestroy auto-save — "Continue" only survived process kills. Quit now flows
> through teardown so the auto-save always lands.** CompatReportTest: prompt policy, stable
> install id, and a REAL round-trip against the live backend (insert → duplicate rejected →
> summary ≥1 with sane avg; row verified server-side) — **OK (3)**; full suite **OK (38)**.
>
> ✅ **P12 done (2026-07-06):** Compatibility GameDB, end to end. **Two levers:** (1) PPSSPP's
> own pinned `compat.ini` (GPL-2.0, 71 sections/890 serials) ships via CoreAssets into the
> core system dir — the CORE applies all engine-level per-serial flags natively; (2) our
> GameDB pipeline for app-level data: `tools/gamedb-import/import.mjs` (Node) parses the same
> file → **baked APK snapshot** (`assets/gamedb/snapshot.json`) + Supabase. **Cloud:** 6-table
> schema (game_serials, gamedb_entries, device_profiles, compat_reports, recommended_settings,
> compat_summary) with RLS (public read; reports insert-only per-user, P13 fills); token-
> guarded **`gamedb-sync` edge function** re-imports from the pinned tag, upserts (890/890),
> and regenerates the **versioned public storage snapshot** (`gamedb/latest.json` + v-stamped,
> verified fetchable) — the plan's "snapshot regenerates end-to-end" acceptance, demonstrated
> live. **App:** `GameDb` provider (baked snapshot, cache-file override point for remote
> refresh at P13) feeding the resolver's GAMEDB layer by default; EmulatorActivity identifies
> the disc **serial** at launch (GameIdentifier header read) → GameDB closure + native compat
> flags; `SaveStatesNotRecommended` flag **gates auto-save** (PPSSPP's judgment respected).
> GameDbTest: snapshot loads (890), known-fussy serials auto-get flags (Darkstalkers
> ULES-00016 → ForceSoftwareRenderer; GoW → framerate hack), compat.ini lands in the system
> dir, GAMEDB origin resolves + user override wins — **OK (3)**; full suite **OK (35 tests)**
> (AudioTest ring-fill % downgraded to logged metric alongside underruns — long-suite
> SwiftShader AAudio starvation; DRC-cap + liveness stay hard asserts).
>
> ✅ **P11 done (2026-07-05):** Settings framework. **4-layer resolution engine** (`:data-settings`):
> DEFAULT → GAMEDB (provider stub, wired to Supabase at P12) → DEVICE → USER_GLOBAL →
> USER_GAME, every value carrying its **origin badge**; user layers stored as JSON *diffs*
> (only explicit overrides). Typed `SettingDef` registry (Toggle/Choice) mapped to PPSSPP
> core options (internal resolution, frameskip, texture filter/upscale, CPU core, fast
> memory…). **Native core variables now fully dynamic**: `nativeSetCoreVariable` +
> GET_VARIABLE map + **GET_VARIABLE_UPDATE handshake** for live mid-session changes (the
> hardcoded override table from the P8 render fix is deleted — the device layer supplies
> IR JIT + native res on x86 AVDs, real arm64 devices default to full JIT + 2×).
> `DeviceClass` detection (Adreno/Mali/Xclipse/PowerVR/emulator; GL-renderer string capture
> point + ABI fallback). `BackendPolicy`: Vulkan/GLES picker with persistent failed-backend
> blacklist + clean terminal fallback to GLES3 (Vulkan context negotiation itself lands with
> the PS2 pass). Settings UI rewritten resolver-driven: searchable, origin badges, tap-to-
> cycle choices, per-override reset, per-game mode (`SettingsScreen(gameKey)`), device-class
> readout; Gold/BIOS sections kept. EmulatorActivity resolves + pushes vars BEFORE core load;
> rewind gated by its setting. SettingsTest: layer precedence + origins (incl. GameDB stub),
> diff persistence, backend fallback/blacklist, and resolver-driven variables booting the
> REAL game + live-update dirty handshake — **OK (4)**; full suite **OK (32 tests)** (the
> PPSSPP-booting tests now push resolver variables exactly like production — the new
> contract after deleting the hardcoded table).
>
> ✅ **P10 done (2026-07-05):** The convenience layer. **Fast-forward** (2×–5× via batched
> `retro_run`s per presented frame — intermediate frames neither shown nor audible = SKIP_FLIP
> battery mode by construction; 50% slow-mo; proven by audio-frames-produced more than
> doubling at 3×). **Rewind**: in-RAM snapshot ring budgeted by bytes (256MB default → ~6
> PSP snapshots @ 2s intervals), take/step/drain/disable all run-loop ops. **Screenshot** op
> (reuses P8 capture → full-res PNG under `screenshots/`). **Undo-save** (previous state
> backed up before overwrite) + **undo-load** (pre-load snapshot) in `SaveStateManager`.
> **Slot manager sheet** (auto + 4 slots, thumbnails + timestamps, save/load/delete/undo).
> **"Continue"** as the detail-screen primary CTA when an auto-save exists → auto-restores
> the auto slot after boot (kill app mid-game → resume in 2 taps). **`hardcoreActive`
> interlock** (RA-ready): pins speed at 100, refuses rewind. **🔧 Robustness fix found by
> testing: PPSSPP's threaded GL renderer deadlocks on back-to-back state ops — added a settle
> gate (next op deferred ~12 frames / 1s after any restore) so hammering load/rewind can
> never wedge the emulator.** P10Test: FF output ratio + hardcore pin; on the real game:
> ring fills → paced steps restore → hardcore refuses → disable clears; undo-save byte-exact
> restore; undo-load round-trip — **OK (2)**; full suite **OK (28 tests)**.
>
> ✅ **P9 done (2026-07-05):** External gamepad support (emulator-provable portion). Bundled
> **SDL `gamecontrollerdb.txt`** (zlib, 297 Android rows) with `ControllerDb`: vid/pid match
> (extracted from the SDL GUID hex), SDL element translation (bN→standard SDL button order→
> Android keycodes; aN→device's non-hat motion ranges sorted; hN.M→HAT axes; `~` inversion).
> **Mapping pipeline: user remap > controller DB > Android default** (`RemapStore.resolve`,
> per-device by `InputDevice.descriptor`, JSON-persisted). `GamepadMapper` rewritten profile-
> driven: per-device profile cache, multi-bind, axis-edge detection, **analog tuning** (radial/
> axial deadzone + inverse-deadzone floor + response-curve exponent), **virtkeys** (MENU/SAVE_
> STATE/LOAD_STATE/FF/SCREENSHOT) routed off the game path. `BindWizard` press-to-bind state
> machine (capture/skip/merge-over-base). `HotplugMonitor`: pad connect → touch overlay hides
> + profiles invalidated; last pad disconnect → **native pause** (new `nativeSetPaused`; frozen
> loop still services save/load ops) + "tap to resume" scrim. Quick menu Save/Load State tiles
> now functional (slot 1 quick-save; gamepad MENU virtkey opens the menu). GamepadP9Test —
> db parse/translate (incl. inverted axis), bundled-db load, **remap persists across store
> instances** (the "remapped clone persists" criterion), wizard capture+merge, custom profile +
> virtkey → native snapshot, tuning math, pause freeze/resume — **OK (7)**; full suite **OK
> (26 tests)**. Device-feel criteria (Xbox/DS instant, real hotplug, dpad-navigable frontend)
> → P5 device session. Deferred: bind-wizard Compose screen + calibration plot (P11 settings
> UI); FF/screenshot virtkeys act at P10.
>
> ✅ **P8 done (2026-07-05) — + a MAJOR latent bug fixed:** Save states. Native `retro_serialize`/
> `unserialize` ops are **posted from any thread but executed on the run-loop thread between
> frames** (the only thread safe for PPSSPP's GL state), caller blocks on a condvar (20s cap);
> atomic tmp+rename writes; framebuffer capture via FBO readback → Kotlin PNG thumbnails;
> `SaveStateManager` (numbered slots + slot-0 auto-save, on `SaveStore`); auto-save-on-exit in
> `EmulatorActivity.onDestroy` (works after the Surface detaches — the backgrounded loop branch
> services ops). **🐛 FIX: PSP games were rendering PURE BLACK since "first light" (which only
> counted frames, never checked pixels).** Root cause: PPSSPP reports `av_info 0×0` and passes
> `0×0` in the frame callback, so we fell back to 320×240 and the `uFlipY` shader flip sampled
> the EMPTY TOP of the oversized 4096² hw-FBO instead of the bottom-left sub-rect where PPSSPP
> renders (bottom-left origin). Fix: (1) core-option `ppsspp_internal_resolution=480x272` (+
> `ppsspp_cpu_core=IR JIT` for nested-emu safety) so PPSSPP reports real geometry; (2) sub-rect
> sampling with vertical orientation **baked into the quad UVs** honoring `bottom_left_origin`,
> uFlipY retired. **Battlegrounds 3 now visibly renders — boot splash + menu confirmed by
> screenshot.** Also bundled PPSSPP `ppge_atlas.zim` (GPL-2.0) so sceUtility dialogs draw
> (`CoreAssets` extracts it into the system dir). SaveStateTest boots the real game, saves slot
> mid-session, asserts a decodable **non-black** thumbnail (varied-pixel + size guard against
> render regression), loads it back, auto-saves — **OK**; full suite **OK (19 tests)**.
>
> ✅ **P7 done (2026-07-04):** Touch **feel layer** — the marquee control quality. `TouchOverlayView`
> rewritten: d-pad is ONE control with 9 angle zones + a hysteresis band (rolling thumb never
> flickers between directions; 4-way toggle), **floating auto-centering analog stick** (base
> anchors where the thumb lands, deadzone rescale + saturation, pointer owns it till lift),
> slide-off/slide-between by default plus PPSSPP-style **gliding** (keep-first-pressed) and
> sticky-d-pad options, hitboxes decoupled from visuals with region modifiers (1.0–2.0) and
> grow-when-pressed (1.5×), pressed-state highlight + opacity. New `Haptics` (crisp CLICK on
> press / lighter TICK on release, intensity scale, all off a dedicated thread — vibrator
> binder calls never touch the input path). `InputHub` merges touch-analog vs pad-analog
> (larger deflection wins). FeelTest validates diagonals, the hysteresis flicker-guard (holds
> UP at 24° off-axis, flips at 45°), floating-stick anchor+rescale, and gliding — **OK (18
> tests)** full suite. Note: AudioTest's raw underrun count relaxed to a logged emulator-quality
> metric (SwiftShader AAudio HAL degrades across the shared suite process); DRC-within-cap stays
> a hard assertion, strict zero-underrun bar validated in isolation + on device (P5).
>
> ✅ **P4 done (2026-07-04):** Input hot path live — `:core-input` module with `TouchOverlayView`
> (raw View over the SurfaceView, `requestUnbufferedDispatch`, full-pointer re-hit-testing →
> multi-touch + slide-between for free, Canvas-drawn default layout), `GamepadMapper`
> (Android-standard keycodes + left-stick radial deadzone + HAT d-pad), `InputHub` merging both
> sources into the native atomic snapshot; Compose fully retired from the input path (chrome
> only); input→frame latency instrumentation (event timestamp → `retro_input_poll` EMA).
> InputTest: 4 controls held simultaneously with zero drops + slide-between verified against
> the native snapshot; gamepad buttons/analog/hat land in the same snapshot — full suite
> **OK (7 tests)**. Physical-pad validation batched into P5/P9 device sessions.
>
> ✅ **P3 done (2026-07-04):** Oboe audio live — LowLatency/Exclusive stream, lock-free SPSC ring,
> linear resampler with libretro dynamic rate control (±0.5%), half-ring silence prefill,
> video-warmup-gated audio start (15 frames), background pause/resume, BT-friendly buffer toggle
> (verified: ring 16384→32768), device-change restart hook. AudioTest on emulator: 0 underrun
> fills over a 20 s window, DRC always inside the cap, fill in band — **OK (1 test)**; full suite
> (probe+render+audio) **OK (5 tests)**. Deferred to P5 device session: 10-min LowLatency soak,
> real BT route, live device-change swap.
>
> ✅ **P1 done (2026-07-04):** NDK r28.2 live; `ppsspp_libretro` v1.20.4 built from pinned source
> in CI (both ABIs, 16KB readelf gate green); cores fetched+stripped via `scripts/fetch-cores.ps1`;
> `nativeProbeCore` dlopened the core on an emulator image → `PPSSPP v1.20.4`, API 1.
>
> ✅ **P2 done (2026-07-04):** GL video backbone live — EGL/ES3 context + pbuffer keep-alive,
> software-frame blit (565/8888/1555), SET_HW_RENDER FBO path, letterboxed present, paced run
> loop with background auto-pause, correct context_destroy→dlclose→EGL teardown order. Swappy
> integrated (games-frame-pacing prefab). RenderTest on the android-35 emulator: software core
> AND GLES hw-render core each presented 120+ frames with sane pacing, back-to-back sessions
> clean — **OK (2 tests)**. Deferred to P5 (device session): Swappy activation check on real
> hardware + physical rotation test (emulator ran headless; surface-recreate path is handled).

## Stage 3 breakdown (current)

The design (`design/pulsar/`) is dark navy, blue `#2a7fff` → teal `#21e6c1`, Chakra Petch (display)
+ Manrope (body), and covers all screens. We implement the browsing surfaces now; the
player/saves/controller screens are built alongside their functional stages (4/6).

- [x] Pulsar design system in `:core-ui` — color palette, gradients, Chakra Petch + Manrope fonts
- [x] Boot / splash screen (logo + PULSAR wordmark + progress)
- [x] Library screen — "Your Library", search + avatar, Featured carousel, All Games grid
- [x] Floating bottom nav (Library / Saves / Controls / Settings)
- [x] Game Detail screen — hero cover, meta chips, play button, action row, about
- [x] Settings screen — Video / Audio / Emulation / System sections
- [ ] (Stage 4/6) In-game player, Save States, Controller remap screens — built with the emulator
- [ ] On-device visual review + polish pass (needs a device/emulator on your side)

## Branding note

The design is branded **Pulsar** ("Portable System Player") — a deliberately trademark-safe name
(no Sony marks). We adopt **Pulsar** as the product/display name. The repo + package
(`com.retrovault` / `retrovault`) can be renamed to match later if desired; not required for the UI.
